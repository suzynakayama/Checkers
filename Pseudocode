--> Game rules:
    - 2 players
    - 64 cells (32 white and 32 black)
    - Moves are diagonally:
        - regular piece:
            - moves only foward
            - moves 1 cell each time unless the opposite player is there, then he can "eat" the opposite piece jumping over it
            - multiple jumps allowed during 1 turn
            - if the player can "eat" the opposite piece, it has to do it
        - king piece (when player's piece reache the other side of the board):
            - can move foward or backward
            - can move more than 1 cell at a time

    - Get the start cell clicked and the end cell clicked
    - Check if there is an opposite piece in that cell or the other diagonal cell
        - If yes:
            - check if there is an empty cell after it:
                - if yes: player will jump over that cell
                - if no: render msg that player cannot go this diagonal

        - If it's the other diagonal, render msg that player needs to "eat" that piece
        - If opposite piece on both diagonals, let player choose
    - check winner
    - switch turns
    - render the board

--> When a king piece moves:
    - Get the start cell clicked and the end cell clicked
    - Check if there is any opposite pieces in the middle cells with white pieces in between
        - If yes:
            - check if there is an empty cell after it:
                - if yes: player will jump over that cell
                - if no: render msg that player cannot go this diagonal

        - If it's the other diagonal, render msg that player needs to "eat" that piece
        - If opposite piece on both diagonals, let player choose
